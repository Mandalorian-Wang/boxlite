/**
 * The wait, said once — as a box.
 *
 * This screen used to announce "BOOTING CONSOLE" in 17px letterspaced caps:
 * the loudest thing on it, narrating the wait rather than filling it, and not
 * true besides (a bundle is arriving, nothing is booting). Three loops ran at
 * once — a pulsing square, its glow, and a cycling ellipsis — none of which
 * said anything about what this product is.
 *
 * What it is, is boxes. So the wait is one assembling: three faces drawing in,
 * the top catching the light when they meet. The wording lives in `sr-only`
 * text, where an assistive reader needs it and a sighted reader does not.
